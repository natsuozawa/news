      <div id="gpmb_body_root"><p>I am starting a 3-month internship as a Forward Deployed Software Engineer (FDSE) at Palantir Technologies Tokyo office. Working as both a software engineer and product manager, I will contribute to solving critical business and technology challenges faced by Japanese companies.</p>
<h2 id="about-palantir">About Palantir</h2>
<p>Palantir was co-founded by PayPal founder Peter Thiel in the US and works with governments and large corporations on digital transformation across all industries. I have heard that the Japanese office is still small and is like a start-up environment - I hope to contribute to Palantir's growth in the Japanese market.</p>
<p>There are many companies working on digital transformation, but I think Palantir's technical expertise and business model are unique. Palantir's first customers were the US intelligence community and military, for whom they developed general-purpose software to analyze large amounts of sensitive data and make a variety of instantaneous decisions.</p>
<p>Palantir's systems have been deployed in manufacturing, healthcare, government, finance, logistics, and other industries around the world. Palantir makes business processes smarter, enabling businesses to behave like code (accurate, agile, fast decision making, and Scalable). This is called Business as Code.</p>
<p>Palantir sends software engineers, called FDSEs, to client companies to identify their business process transformation and engineering challenges and provide strong support for DX by integrating products developed in the US and UK with client company systems.</p>
<p>Through this business model, I believe we can provide Japanese companies with the power of high-level software.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>I would like to thank the human resources department for their assistance leading up to the start of my internship. I look forward to working with Palantir for the next three months.</p>
